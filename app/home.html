    <p>A large number of children, especially in the rural and backward areas of India, do not yet have access to proper schooling. What is available is either of poor quality or beyond their reach. It is only the rich and the elite classes who can afford
        a modicum of good education for their children. This disparity in the educational opportunities available to different classes is a major hurdle in moving towards the cherished goal of creating a good, just and harmonious social order. The government
        is doing what it can to expand and improve the quality of education. But the desired goal can be achieved more effectively with the participation of the local community and the larger civil society. It is this sense of social responsibility which
        has prompted us to undertake this school project. Our<strong> objective is to create a school in a rural area and to develop it as a model for top quality yet affordable education </strong>that could be replicated in other areas.</p>

    <header>Our Vision of a Good School</header>
    <p>Educating children is not just making them literate or helping them secure good marks in the Board examinations. It is also not making them merely 'smart' and computer savvy. It should have much higher and futuristic goals. In our view, a good and meaningful education for the future citizens of the fast developing and globalizing India should have the following main dimensions:
        <ul class="homeList">
            <li>It should develop the academic and intellectual potentials of the students. It should equip them with modern knowledge and skills needed to succeed in life and to improve their socio-economic status. Simultaneously, it should help them grow as competent, confident and responsible persons who can manage well their life, their work, and their country.</li>
            <li>It should make them locally and globally aware and committed. This should help them become good members of the community and good citizens, who can contribute to the collective social and human advancement.</li>
            <li>It should refine the human and moral sensitivities of the students and help them grow as good human beings. It should help them live in harmony with their social and natural environment, and lead a happy and meaningful life.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Modern education at its best focuses only on the first goal, i.e. in making students competent and successful. The other
    two goals of making them good citizens and good human beings are being mostly neglected.</p>

    <header>Strategy for providing good education</header>
    <p>The real challenge, however, is in finding practical ways of translating these idealistic goals into reality. For that we need creative efforts to think up new ideas, experiment with them and incorporate them into the curricular and extra-curricular
        activities of the school. And more importantly, we need competent, creative and committed teachers and school managers who can impart such a good and meaningful education. The teachers themselves must possess the qualities we wish to develop in
        the students. Such teachers are not easy to come by. We will have to build them also, along with building the school. Doing that will also be a goal of the school.</p>

    <p>In addition to imparting a good education, a school should also help its students grow in many other ways. It should help them cope up with the socio-psychological problems of growing from childhood to adolescence. It should also develop their social
        skills and overall personality. The school should provide them information and guidance about higher education, career opportunities and professional training after the school. These should be done through personal counseling, training workshops,
        lectures, etc.</p>

    <header>Obligations of a rural school</header>
    <p>A school in rural area should also serve as a facilitator for promoting cultural and socio-economic development of the community in which it is situated. It should collaborate with governmental and other agencies in organizing various promotional
        activities in areas like, health-care, family planning, adult education, environmental conservation, water management, etc. These activities will help develop stronger bonds between the school and the community.</p>
