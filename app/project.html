  <p>
    As our first project, we are building a rural school in Varanasi. The estimated cost of the project is Rs. 6 crore. To raise
    funds needed for the project, a public charitable trust was formed in September 2010. Late Smt. Kesari Devi had willed
    her life savings, amounting to Rs. 3 lac for the school project. It formed the nucleus of the trust. Hence, the trust
    has been named 'KESARI DEVI CHARITABLE TRUST'.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shortly after formation of the Trust we launched a fund collection drive. It targeted mainly our family, colleagues, friends
    and former students. That is, those who know us and trust us. Thanks to their generous support we have been able to raise
    sufficient funds to acquire a piece of land for the school, measuring 0.261 hectare (= 2610 Sq. metres = 28084 Sq. feet),
    in 2013. We have also secured the valuable partnership of a social service organization, Round Table India (Varanasi
    chapter). They are funding the construction of the school building. The school named <strong>Round Table Abhinav Vidyalaya</strong>    is coming up in the village Kosara, in the Mirza Murad area of Varanasi, about 25 Km. to the west of the city.
  </p>
  <p>
    The school started functioning in the year 2015 with 2 rooms, 14 students and 2 teachers. In the succeeding years, more classes
    were added and the students strength steadily grew to 120. At present, we have classes from Pre nursery to Class IV.
    In the first phase, we will build the school up to the junior high school level (up to Class VIII). This phase would
    be completed by year 2021. In the second phase, we will expand up to the higher secondary level (Class XII).

  <header>Our Present Needs</header>
  <p>
    Our present needs are of three kinds:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><u>Corpus fund for development and expansion</u></strong><br> This includes funds for acquiring more land
        for expanding the sports ground, equipping classrooms with furniture and modern teaching aids, furnishings and equipment
        for laboratories, furniture for library, office, teachers' room, principal room, campus development, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><u>Funds for subsidizing the running costs of the school</u></strong><br> The cost of educating a child at
        the primary level works out at Rs. 800/month. However, to make good education available to the children from weaker
        sections, the fee being charged has been kept at a low level of Rs. 300/month. This creates a shortfall of Rs. 500/child
        per month, or Rs. 6000/year. We invite donors to sponsor the education of a child by donating the above amount under
        <strong>Sponsor a Child</strong> program.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><u>Endowment fund for training programs and co-curricular activities</u></strong><br> We also plan to create
        a permanent endowment fund whose interest / dividend would be utilized to support activities like regular training
        programs for teachers, tours and excursions for students, and other developmental activities.
      </li>
    </ul>
