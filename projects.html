            <h1>Milestones &amp; the road ahead</h1>
            <p>
                As our first project, we are building a rural school in Varanasi. The estimated cost of the project is
                Rs. 6 crore.
                To raise the funds needed for the project, a public charitable trust was formed in September 2010. Late
                Smt. Kesari
                Devi had willed her life savings, amounting to Rs. 3 lac for the school project. It formed the nucleus
                of the trust.
                Hence, the trust has been named <strong>KESARI DEVI CHARITABLE TRUST</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after formation of the Trust we launched a fund collection drive. It targeted mainly our family,
                colleagues,
                friends and former students. That is, those who know us and trust us. Thanks to their generous support
                we have been
                able to raise sufficient funds to acquire a piece of land for the school, measuring 0.261 hectare (=
                2610 Sq. metres
                = 28084 Sq. feet), in 2013. We have also secured the valuable partnership of a social service
                organization, Round
                Table India (Varanasi chapter). They are funding the construction of the school building. The school
                named
                <strong>Round Table Abhinav Vidyalaya</strong> is coming up in the village Kosara, in the Mirza Murad
                area of
                Varanasi, about 25 Km. to the west of the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                The school started functioning in the year 2015 with 2 rooms, 14 students and 2 teachers. In the
                succeeding years,
                more classes were added and the students strength steadily grew to 120. At present, we have classes from
                Pre nursery
                to Class IV. In the first phase, we will build the school up to the junior high school level (up to
                Class VIII).
                This phase would be completed by year 2021. In the second phase, we will expand up to the higher
                secondary level
                (Class XII).
            </p>
            <h1>Our Present Needs</h1>
            <p>
                Our present needs are of three kinds:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong><u>Corpus fund for development and expansion</u></strong><br> This includes funds for
                        acquiring more
                        land for expanding the sports ground, equipping classrooms with furniture and modern teaching
                        aids, furnishings
                        and equipment for laboratories, furniture for library, office, teachers' room, principal room,
                        campus
                        development, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><u>Funds for subsidizing the running costs of the school</u></strong><br> The cost of
                        educating a child
                        at the primary level works out at Rs. 800/month. However, to make good education available to
                        the children from
                        weaker sections, the fee being charged has been kept at a low level of Rs. 300/month. This
                        creates a shortfall
                        of Rs. 500/child per month, or Rs. 6000/year. We invite donors to sponsor the education of a
                        child by donating
                        the above amount under <strong>Sponsor a Child</strong> program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><u>Endowment fund for training programs and co-curricular activities</u></strong><br> We
                        also plan to
                        create a permanent endowment fund whose interest / dividend would be utilized to support
                        activities like regular
                        training programs for teachers, tours and excursions for students, and other developmental
                        activities.
                    </li>
                </ul>
