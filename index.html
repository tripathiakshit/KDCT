            <h1>Preamble</h1>
            <img src="media/pic1.jpg" style="float: right;margin: 1rem;shape-outside: ellipse();" />
            <p>A large number of children, especially in the rural and backward areas of India, do not yet have access
                to proper
                schooling. What is available is either of poor quality or beyond their reach. It is only the rich and
                the elite
                classes who can afford a modicum of good education for their children. This disparity in the educational
                opportunities available to different classes is a major hurdle in moving towards the cherished goal of
                creating
                a good, just and harmonious social order. The government is doing what it can to expand and improve the
                quality
                of education. But the desired goal can be achieved more effectively with the participation of the local
                community and the larger civil society. It is this sense of social responsibility which has prompted us
                to
                undertake this school project. Our<strong> objective is to create a school in a rural area and to
                    develop it as
                    a model for top quality yet affordable education </strong>that could be replicated in other areas.
            </p>
            <h1>Our Vision of a Good School</h1>
            <p>Educating children is not just making them literate or helping them secure good marks in the Board
                examinations.
                It is also not making them merely 'smart' and computer savvy. It should have much higher and futuristic
                goals.
                In our view, a good and meaningful education for the future citizens of the fast developing and
                globalizing
                India should have the following main dimensions:
                <ul class="homeList">
                    <li>It should develop the academic and intellectual potentials of the students. It should equip them
                        with
                        modern knowledge and skills needed to succeed in life and to improve their socio-economic
                        status.
                        Simultaneously, it should help them grow as competent, confident and responsible persons who can
                        manage
                        well their life, their work, and their country.</li>
                    <li>It should make them locally and globally aware and committed. This should help them become good
                        members
                        of the community and good citizens, who can contribute to the collective social and human
                        advancement.
                    </li>
                    <li>It should refine the human and moral sensitivities of the students and help them grow as good
                        human
                        beings. It should help them live in harmony with their social and natural environment, and lead
                        a happy
                        and meaningful life.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Modern education at its best focuses only on the first goal, i.e. in making students competent and
                successful.
                The other
                two goals of making them good citizens and good human beings are being mostly neglected.</p>
            <h1>Strategy for providing good education</h1>
            <p>The real challenge, however, is in finding practical ways of translating these idealistic goals into
                reality. For
                that we need creative efforts to think up new ideas, experiment with them and incorporate them into the
                curricular and extra-curricular
                activities of the school. And more importantly, we need competent, creative and committed teachers and
                school
                managers who can impart such a good and meaningful education. The teachers themselves must possess the
                qualities
                we wish to develop in
                the students. Such teachers are not easy to come by. We will have to build them also, along with
                building the
                school. Doing that will also be a goal of the school.</p>

                style="float: left;margin: 1rem;shape-outside: ellipse();" />
            <p>In addition to imparting a good education, a school should also help its students grow in many other
                ways. It
                should help them cope up with the socio-psychological problems of growing from childhood to adolescence.
                It
                should also develop their social
                skills and overall personality. The school should provide them information and guidance about higher
                education,
                career opportunities and professional training after the school. These should be done through personal
                counseling, training workshops,
                lectures, etc.</p>
            <h1>Obligations of a rural school</h1>
            <p>A school in rural area should also serve as a facilitator for promoting cultural and socio-economic
                development
                of the community in which it is situated. It should collaborate with governmental and other agencies in
                organizing various promotional
                activities in areas like, health-care, family planning, adult education, environmental conservation,
                water
                management, etc. These activities will help develop stronger bonds between the school and the community.
